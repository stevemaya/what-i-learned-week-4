### **Loops**
-   `for:`  loops through a block of code a number of times.
-   `for/in:`  loops through the properties of an object.
-   `for/of:`  loops through the values of an iterable object.
-   `while:`  loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.

### **Arrays**
-   An array is used to store multiple values in a single variable.
-   You access an array element by referring to the index number.
-   Array indexes start with `[0]` referring to the first element in the array.


### **Array Methods**
-   `.Pop():`  Removes an item from the end of an array.                                                 
-   `.Push():` Adds items to the end of an array.                                                 
-   `.shift():` Removes an item from the beginning of an array.
-   `.unshift:()`  Adds items to the beginning of an array.
